\title{Calculates weights to distribute bird mortality between colonies and groups of colonies for a given species.
for a given colony, these weights are influenced by: (1) Distance between the colony and the wind parcs,
(2) The population size of the species of interest for that colony and (3), the proportion of marine surface surrounding the colony.}

  max_foraging_range_km,
  colonies,
  sea_area,

  incl_pop_size = T,
  incl_sea_area = T
)
}
\arguments{
\item{max_foraging_range_km}{numeric, maximum foraging range in kilometers for the species of interest}

\item{colonies}{data frame with each row being a colony where the species of interest is present. Must have at least the following columns:
'group': numeric, colonies with the same number belong to the same cluster
'avg': numeric, average population size in that colony over the years of interests
'code_colonie': character, unique identifier for the colony.}

\item{sea_area}{named numeric vector giving for each colony the proportion of marine surface surrounding it.
Each value should be named with the unique identifier for the corresponding colony.}

\item{tbl_dist}{matrix giving the distances between colonies (rows) and wind farms (columns), as outputed by bdy_get_distances()}

\item{incl_pop_size}{boolean, whether population size should influence the weight calculation}

\item{incl_sea_area}{boolean, whether the proportion of marine surface surrounding the colony should influence the weight calculation}
}
\value{
list of 4 matrices:
         'AW_colo' (rows=colonies, columns=parcs): absolute weights for each colony/parc combination
         'RW_colo' (rows=colonies, columns=parcs): relative (normalized) weights for each colony/parc combination (sum of weights for a given parc = 1)
         'AW_group' (rows=groups of colonies, columns=parcs): absolute weights for each group/parc combination
         'RW_group' (rows=groups of colonies, columns=parcs): relative (normalized) weights for each group/parc combination (sum of weights for a given parc = 1)
