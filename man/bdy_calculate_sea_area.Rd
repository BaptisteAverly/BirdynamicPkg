\title{Calculate proportion of sea around colony}
\usage{
bdy_calculate_sea_area(shapeFile, max_foraging_range, colonies)
}
\arguments{
\item{shapeFile}{shapefile of the area of interest}

\item{max_foraging_range}{numeric, max foraging range of the species of interest in kilometers
@param colonies sf object with each row being a colony where the species of interest is present. Must have at least the following columns:
\itemize{
\item 'geometry': coordinates of the colony
\item 'code_colonie': character, unique identifier for the colony.
}}
}
\value{
named numeric vector indicating the proportion of sea area for each colony provided
}
\description{
Calculates the proportion of sea area around the colonies of interest (the ratio between marine surface and terrestrial surface within the foraging range of the species of interest).
Used by \code{\link[=bdy_apportionning]{bdy_apportionning()}} to compute mortality weights between colonies.
