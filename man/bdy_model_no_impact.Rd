\arguments{
\item{count_data}{matrix giving annual bird counts for each group of colonies (rows) and each year of interest (columns)}

\item{PI}{matrix giving the proportion of colonies monitored for each group of colonies (rows) and each year of interest (columns)}

\item{survival}{numeric vector giving the survival rates for the different age classes of the species of interest}

\item{fecundity}{numeric vector giving the fecundity rates for the different age classes of the species of interest}

\item{propRepro}{numeric vector giving the proportion of reproductive individual for the different age classes of the species of interest}

\item{modelFile}{character, relative path for the text file containing the population model as jags code}

\item{nimble}{boolean, whether to use nimble of jags to compute the bayesian model}

\item{lightResults}{boolean, whether the output should only be the estimated output useful for the model with impact, or the full posterior distribution (can be quite heavy)}

\item{ny_proj}{number of years from the last annual count for which to compute population projections}

\item{na}{Number of iterations to run in the JAGS adaptive phase}

\item{nb}{Number of iterations at the beginning of the chain to discard (i.e., the burn-in). Does not include the adaptive phase iterations.}

\item{ni}{Total number of iterations per chain (including burn-in).}

\item{nc}{Number of Markov chains to run.}

\item{nt}{Thinning rate. Must be a positive integer.}
}
\value{
Data frame with nrow = ni. \cr
If lightResults=T, columns contain estimated group size for the first year of projection (one column per group of colonies) and estimated annual growth rate (one column per group of colonies).\cr
If lightRestuls=F, columns contain the full posterior distribution: different estimated output for each group of colonies, and each year of interest (count years + projection years). \cr
Refer to the documentation of packages 'nimble' or 'jagsUI' for details.
