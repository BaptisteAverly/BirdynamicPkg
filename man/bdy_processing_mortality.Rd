\title{Distributes national mortality among all colonies of a given species, based on weights calculated with bdy_apportionning}
\usage{
bdy_processing_mortality(
  collision,
  season,
  n_iteration = 1000,
  parcNames,
  RW_group
)
}
\arguments{
\item{collision}{data frame giving mortality estimates for the species of interest and the wind farms of interest.Should have at least the following columns:
'parc': character, names of the parc for which the mortality due to collisions is estimated
'month': numeric, month of the year (1 to 12) for which the mortality is estimated
'iteration': numeric, iteration index of the collision model.
'coefficient': numeric, estimated mortality coefficient from the collision modèle, for a given combination of perc, month and iteration}

\item{season}{character vector of length 12, giving the presence status of the bird of interest on the french coasts for each month of the year, with:
'B' = breeding, 'R' = resident, 'T' = transition, 'M' = mixed, 'V' = visiting, 'A' = absent.
For more details refer to the Birdynamic report by Chambert et al.}

\item{n_iteration}{number of iterations to draw from (shuffled distribution)}

\item{RW_group}{matrix (rows=groups of colonies, columns=parcs) giving relative weights for each group/parc combination,
with sum of weights for a given parc = 1, as outputed by bdy_apportionning}
}
\value{
matrix (rows = iterations, columns = groups of colonies) giving the distribution of mortality accross groups of colonies
}
