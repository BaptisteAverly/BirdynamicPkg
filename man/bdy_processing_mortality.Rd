'parc': character, names of the parc for which the mortality due to collisions is estimated
'month': numeric, month of the year (1 to 12) for which the mortality is estimated
'iteration': numeric, iteration index of the collision model.
'coefficient': numeric, estimated mortality coefficient from the collision modèle, for a given combination of perc, month and iteration}
