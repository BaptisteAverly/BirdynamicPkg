\title{Computes the population model with impact from wind farms for the birds species of interest}
\usage{
bdy_model_with_impact(
  n_group,
  ny_data,
  posterior,
  mortality,
  ni = 1000,
  ny_proj = 30,
  progress = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_group}{numeric, number of groups of colonies for the bird species of interest}

\item{ny_data}{numeric, number of years for which count data exist for the bird species of interest}

\item{posterior}{dataframe, estimated output from bdy_model_no_impact()}

\item{mortality}{distribution of mortality accross groups of colonies, as outputted by bdy_processing_mortality()}

\item{ni}{number of iterations}

\item{ny_proj}{number of years from the last annual count for which to compute population projections}

\item{progress}{R shiny Progress object used to show the calculation progress to the user. Only for use within a shiny application.}
}
\value{
List of two arrays of size (n_group)\emph{(ny_data)}(ni) containing projected population size:
\itemize{
\item sc0:  projections with no impact from wind farms (null model).
\item sc1: projections with impacts from wind farms.
