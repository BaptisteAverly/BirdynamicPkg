\usage{
bdy_get_cost_raster(
  world_map,
  regions = c("Northern Europe", "Southern Europe", "Western Europe"),
  geom,
  N_buffer = 10,
  S_buffer = 10,
  W_buffer = 10,
  E_buffer = 10,
  pixel_size = 1000
)
}
\arguments{
\item{world_map}{sf object of the world with every country. Can be downloaded here:
https://github.com/nvkelso/natural-earth-vector/blob/master/10m_cultural/ne_10m_admin_0_countries.shp}

\item{geom}{vector of geometries, giving the coordinates of bird colonies, wind farms, or others.
This is used to get the extent of the raster to calculate.}

\item{N_buffer}{north buffer to increase the extent of the raster beyond the northernmost colony or parc (numeric, in kilometers)}

\item{S_buffer}{south buffer to increase the extent of the raster beyond the southernmost colony or parc (numeric, in kilometers)}

\item{W_buffer}{west buffer to increase the extent of the raster beyond the westernmost colony or parc (numeric, in kilometers)}

\item{E_buffer}{east buffer to increase the extent of the raster beyond the easternmost colony or parc (numeric, in kilometers)}

\item{pixel_size}{numeric, size in meter of the cells represented by one pixel of the raster. Lower numbers give higher resolution, but greatly increase computing time.}

\item{region}{regions of the world where the analysis should take place. Subsetting on the regions of interest can speed up the calculation.
Can be any or a combination of the following: \cr
"All","South-Eastern Asia","South America","Western Asia","Southern Asia","Eastern Asia",
"Eastern Africa","Western Europe","Northern Africa","Central America","Middle Africa",
"Eastern Europe","Southern Africa","Caribbean","Central Asia","Northern Europe",
"Southern Europe","Western Africa","Northern America","Melanesia","Antarctica",
"Australia and New Zealand","Polynesia","Micronesia"}
}
\value{
List of 2 elements:
\itemize{
\item 'transition_matrix': transitionLayer object where sea is represented as low cost and land is represented as high cost
\item 'cost_raster': raster object where sea is represented as low cost and land is represented as high cost
}
}
\description{
Produces the transition matrix and cost raster used to calculate shortest path distances for birds with marine exclusive livestyles.
