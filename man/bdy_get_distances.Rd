\title{Calculates the shortest path distances between marine bird colonies and wind farms}
\usage{
bdy_get_distances(colonies, parcs, costMatrix, doShpa = T, progress = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{colonies}{table where each row is a colony of interest.
Must contain one column named "code_colonie" with unique identifiers for each colony
and one spatial "geometry" column containing the coordinates of the colony centroids}

\item{parcs}{table where each row is a wind famr of interest.
Must contain one column named "NAME" with unique identifiers for each wind farm
and one spatial "geometry" column containing the coordinates of the wind farm centroids}

\item{costMatrix}{cost raster (Transition object from package gdistance) representing the land areas as costly and marine areas as cost free.
Used to calculate shortest path distances for strictly marine birds which do not fly over the land.}

\item{doShpa}{boolean. If set to false, only the euclidean distance is calculated which makes the computation faster, especially if there are many wind farms.}

\item{progress}{R shiny Progress object used to show the calculation progress to the user. Only for use within a shiny application.}
}
\value{
List containing 2 matrices with identical format (colonies as rows and wind farms as columns): \cr
'eucl_dist' contains the euclidian distances and 'shpa_dist' contains the shortest path distances (filled with NAs if doShpa=F)
}
